Lab Assignment 2

Q1 The following figure shows the start state and goal state for the 8-puzzle problem.
Find the number of states explored before reaching the goal state using the BFS
algorithm.

Q2 Find the number of states explored for the DFS algorithm. Give comparison of BFS
and DFS in terms of cost if the path cost for the state is given as depth of the search tree
at which the state is occurring.
